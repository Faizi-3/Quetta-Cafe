        <b><i>About Us</i></b>
        <br>
        Quetta Chaie Cafe isn't just a place to grab a cup of tea. It's an experience, a journey through the rich flavors
        and vibrant culture of Pakistan. We're passionate about crafting the perfect cuppa, using time-honored recipes and
        the finest ingredients. But we're also about much more than that.
        <br>
        <b><i>Our Story</i></b>
        <br>
        Our story began with a simple ambition: to share the warmth and joy of a hot cup of chai with the world. Inspired by
        the bustling chaikhanas of Quetta, we set out to create a space where everyone could come together, unwind, and
        connect over a shared love of good food and good company.
