                    Masala tea is more than just a beverage; it's a cultural touchstone. It's the steam rising from a clay pot in a bustling Indian market, the clinking of cups as friends gather, the stories whispered over shared sips.
                    It's the warmth that chases away winter's chill and the sweetness that lingers long after the last drop.
                    So, next time you crave a comforting and flavorful experience, brew yourself a cup of masala tea. Let the spices embrace you, the sweetness delight you, and the warmth fill you with the spirit of chai.

                Descend to the plains of Punjab, where Doodh Patti reigns supreme. Picture strong black tea swirling in creamy milk, its simplicity belying a depth of comfort that fuels conversations and fuels chai stalls alike. 
                Each region plays its own melody on the masala chai canvas. 
                Ginger and cardamom might lead the chorus in Sindh, while cloves and black pepper add a spicy kick in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

                Kashmiri tea leaves are very similar to green tea in that they are minimally oxidized, and many people use the latter when they can't find the former. Because the Kashmiri variety of tea leaf is only found in Kashmir, it's usually more expensive than other varieties.
                Making Kashmiri chai requires patience. The process starts with heating up water to a simmer, then adding the loose-leaf tea. Then, you take a big whisk and beat the tea water for twenty minutes, to start introducing air into the mixture. The next step involves taking a large ladle and spooning the tea up and down, in and out of the pot, as another way to aerate the tea—this happens in fifteen-minute intervals over two hours (a pretty intense arm workout!). 
                That addition of air is what gives the tea its pink color.
                After the tea has been properly aerated, equal amounts of milk are added, the tea is left to steep for a little longer, and then it is finished with some salt, sugar, and crushed pistachios. According to Ali, the traditionalists just add salt (hence the name noon chai), whereas those with a preference for Western tea preparations will just add sugar, omitting the salt entirely.
                Ali describes the taste as "a creamy, milky citrus. Like a Creamsicle with flowers in it." Even though the drink bears the name "chai," the taste is quite different. While chai relies on a bold mixture of spices (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and the like), Kashmiri chai is delicate. 
                If spices are used, they're usually just small amounts of cinnamon or cardamom. 
                Ali often uses Kashmiri chai as a base for ice cream, topping it with sea salt, crushed pistachios and candied rose petals, or as a soak for her cakes.
                There's a variety of pastries that can accompany Kashmiri chai, and one of the most common is called naan khatai—a type of shortbread cookie with brown sugar caramel baked on top. 
                "You get this sticky, slightly sweet caramel stuck in the back of your tooth when you bite into it, and then when you have the hot tea, that caramel literally melts in your mouth," Ali says. "That rich butteriness goes really well with hot beverages. It is a classic Kashmiri combo."
